# üßë‚Äçüíª Week One Review

## üìù Overview

This week's objective is to:

1. **Review/practice** course content
2. **Work** on your final project
3. **Prepare** for your **final project presentation**

## üìù In class project/activites

These are weekly activities to review old course content. This is the best way to identify any gaps in your knowledge, and **_MOST IMPORTANTLY_** ask during class in our **_one-on-one-sessions_** or in your **_breakout rooms_** with `TAs`.

I have compiled a list of previous projects that most students have not finished yet.

> [!NOTE]
> Choose at least **_ONE_**. The list is ordered from "simple" to more "complex", so choose the one you feel the most comfortable building but at the same time one that you think requires more practice. Lastly, the more you build, the better you get, so please build as many as possible while **_ASKING QUESTIONS IN CLASS_**.

1. Frontend Static work: [fylo](https://github.com/juan-instructor/react-fylo)
2. Frontend Static work: [huddle](https://github.com/juan-instructor/huddle-react)

> [!NOTE]
> If you have finished and you are going to present one of them on Thursday (presentation guideliens are described below), then make sure you have created multiple and **_reusable_** components.

3. Frontend Interactive (state) work: [advice-generator](https://github.com/juan-instructor/api-advice-generator)
4. Frontend Interactive (state) work: [rating-component](https://github.com/juan-instructor/easy-interactive-rating-component)
5. Frontend Interactive (state) work: [notifications-page](https://github.com/juan-instructor/easy-notifications-page)
6. Frontend Interactive (state) work: [age-calculator](https://github.com/juan-instructor/easy--age-calculator)

> [!NOTE]
> I highly suggest completing item 7 from backend work as this really helps you build the foundational knowledge for the `request-response` cycle.

7. Backend work [simple-proxy-server](https://github.com/juan-instructor/your-first-server)
8. Backend work (filesystem) [filesystem-backend](https://github.com/juan-instructor/getting-serious-with-a-server)
9. Backend work (initial auth workflow backend) [simple-auth-service-backend](https://github.com/juan-instructor/simple-auth-service)
10. Backend work (auth handle frontend) [handle-auth-frontend](https://github.com/juan-instructor/auth-frontend-handling)

> [!NOTE]
> Item 11 from the backend work has been updating with complete `/endpoints` in case you have been working on this project.

11. Backend work (database setup and connection) [db-intro-setup](https://github.com/juan-instructor/basic-mongodb-setup)

## Thursday Presentations (2)

Each Thursday you will have a `~15 minutes` presentations, which counts towards your work during class. For your work to be marked as `completed`, it is **_MANDATORY_** to:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This presentation will help you get ready for the final one.

1. On Thursday provide the `GitHub` repo link in `#practice` channel of at least **_ONE_** project you have finished for the week (`in class project-activities`). If you have not fully completed it, then explain why and the challenges you faced in the same `slack` message. Doing this I can help you address those challenges in our next session.

2. On Thursday, present your `in-class project/activity` work in our `one-on-one-session`. **_Presentation guidelines_** will be given below.

3. On Thursday, present your `final course project` (It does not have to be finished). This will help you get more comfortable for the final presentation. Additionally, I will provide feedback so you can implement it in next week's presentation.
